Credits: gwog :3
## What is this?
This is a patch that allows PC players who owned Rocket Arena to play offline vs bots. 
## How do I install it?
Go to the releases tab on the right of this page, and download the latest release. Right click on Rocket Arena in Steam and select Manage -> Browse Local Files. Drag and drop the contents of the zip file into your Rocket Arena folder, and overwrite all files when asked. You only have to do this process once, after this just launch the game normally through Steam.
## How do I use the In-Game Menu?
Instead of using the normal game menus, RocketForever uses it's own overlay menu to configure the game. The menu will appear automatically after a few seconds when the game launches, press F1 to show/hide the overlay menu at any time.
